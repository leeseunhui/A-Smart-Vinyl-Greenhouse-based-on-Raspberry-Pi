a study on the smart vinyl house which is suitable for the growth of plant 
by applying IoT concept to vinyl house.
Based on the raspberry pi, it receives the signals of the camera,
the temperature and humidity sensor, and the soil moisture sensor,
and observes and records indoor and outdoor environments.
